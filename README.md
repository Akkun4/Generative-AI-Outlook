In this project, we examine the challenges of neurodiverse people in maintaining eye contact in video conferencing.
We conducted a close-ended online survey, which was informed by our prior research. We collected responses from
individuals with various neurological conditions, with autism and ADHD standing out as the most prevalent among the
participants. With this work, we gain insight into neurodiverse perspectives on the adoption, usability, uncanniness
and social acceptability of eye contact support in video conferencing.

NVIDIAâ€™s video conferencing software Broadcast v1.4, was referenced in the survey as an eye contact support tool. 
Survey respondents were able to watch a video demonstrating the technology before answering questions about
eye contact support tools in general. The survey consisted of required and optional questions.

A key facet of our work involved leveraging cutting-edge machine learning algorithms for predictive analytics. 
Employing sophisticated feature selection techniques and a robust decision classifier, we unearthed the most predictive features from the dataset. 
This analytical prowess provided a unique and insightful outlook into the neurodivergent population's perspectives on the adoption, usability, uncanniness, and social acceptability of eye contact support in the realm of video conferencing.
